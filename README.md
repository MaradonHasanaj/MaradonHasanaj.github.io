## Work Experience
**Technical Manager @ Ecohouse SRLS (_Jan 2024 - Apr 2024_)**
For a solar panel installation company, I held the responsibility to:

- Control 5 electrical integration of solar panel systems per week, ensuring connectivity between solar modules, inverter, batteries, and home electrical systems.

- Coordinate and manage 2 installation teams to deliver installations on schedule. Deadlines were met 80% of the time on average.

- Conduct business analysis every month to optimize operations.This has led to accepting jobs located within a maximum distance of 100 km from our headquarters.

## Projects
### CAD Designer: Focused on the preliminary design of an Airbus A350, utilizing SolidWorks for 3D modeling.
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Cost Analyst for Space Mission Design: Defined the cost for each phase of a space mission, from preliminary design to operations, using the SSCM model.
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
